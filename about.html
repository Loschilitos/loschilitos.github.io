            <h2>Acts 29 Mission Stories: Church Planting in Los Chilitos</h2>
            <p>As part of our outreach efforts, our church has partnered with organizations like <strong>Acts 29</strong> to support missions in remote regions such as <strong>Los Chilitos, Guatemala</strong>. In this small village, the gospel has been spread through hands-on evangelism, and we’ve had the privilege of helping baptize new believers and witness families and communities being transformed.</p>
